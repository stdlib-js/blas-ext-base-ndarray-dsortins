    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Sort a one-dimensional double-precision floating-point ndarray using insertion sort.

<section class="intro">

</section>

<!-- /.intro -->



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import dsortins from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/blas-ext-base-ndarray-dsortins@v0.1.0-deno/mod.js';
```

#### dsortins( arrays )

Sorts a one-dimensional double-precision floating-point ndarray using insertion sort.

```javascript
import Float64Array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-float64@deno/mod.js';
import scalar2ndarray from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-from-scalar@deno/mod.js';
import ndarray2array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-to-array@deno/mod.js';
import ndarray from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-base-ctor@deno/mod.js';

var xbuf = new Float64Array( [ 1.0, -2.0, 3.0, -4.0 ] );
var x = new ndarray( 'float64', xbuf, [ 4 ], [ 1 ], 0, 'row-major' );

var order = scalar2ndarray( 1.0, {
    'dtype': 'generic'
});

var out = dsortins( [ x, order ] );
// returns <ndarray>

var arr = ndarray2array( out );
// returns [ -4.0, -2.0, 1.0, 3.0 ]
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **arrays**: array-like object containing a one-dimensional input ndarray and a zero-dimensional ndarray specifying the sort order.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The input ndarray is sorted **in-place** (i.e., the input ndarray is **mutated**).
-   When the sort order is less than zero, the input ndarray is sorted in **decreasing** order. When the sort order is greater than zero, the input ndarray is sorted in **increasing** order. When the sort order is equal to zero, the input ndarray is left unchanged.
-   The algorithm distinguishes between `-0` and `+0`. When sorted in increasing order, `-0` is sorted before `+0`. When sorted in decreasing order, `-0` is sorted after `+0`.
-   The algorithm sorts `NaN` values to the end. When sorted in increasing order, `NaN` values are sorted last. When sorted in decreasing order, `NaN` values are sorted first.
-   The algorithm has space complexity `O(1)` and worst case time complexity `O(N^2)`.
-   The algorithm is efficient for **small** ndarrays (typically `N <= 20`) and is particularly efficient for sorting ndarrays which are already substantially sorted.
-   The algorithm is **stable**, meaning that the algorithm does **not** change the order of ndarray elements which are equal or equivalent (e.g., `NaN` values).
